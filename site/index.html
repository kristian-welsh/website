        <p id="centered">I have had an interest in programming since my childhood, and have in the last 2 years made leaps and bounds in improving my style and practices, I started out programming videogames, but my interests quickly moved to the practice of programming in general. I have a passion for making my code as clean as it could possibly be, and having a comprehensive set of fast automated tests. I care greatly about being a responsible software craftsman.</p>
